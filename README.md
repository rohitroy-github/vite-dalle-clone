<h2>vite-dalle-clone</h2>

<b>Project is deployed here : <a href="https://vite-dalle-clone-client.netlify.app/">Link</a> ( Netlify-Github Direct )</b>

This is an <b>AI Image Generation & Sharing Application</b> made using <b>OPEN-AI</b> public API <b>https://openai.com/api/</b>. I have tried to clone the <b><a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a></b> application in this project using <b>Vite</b> and improvised it by adding a community page for showcasing the AI generated images with the community if the user wants to share them. External users can also search for images using <b>keywords</b> and also <b>download images in jpeg format (1024 X 1024)</b> using the <b>community page</b> !

The project is completed but it's open to further modifications and improvement.
